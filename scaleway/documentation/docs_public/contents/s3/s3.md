template: article.jade
---

#### Intro

Our Cloud Storage is 100% S3 compliant, This article will guide you through the process of use existing S3 tools to use our Cloud Storage in CLI

#### Step 1 - Get your token

From the console, on the left side panel go to Storage section

On the page, click on the "S3Creditentials" button, are displayed your `access_key` and the avaibility to manage your creditentials.

Well, let's create your first creditential by clicking `Manage your credentials here`.

#### Step 2 - Download S3Cmd

Then we will use S3Cmd as CLI to manage scalewayS3.
Download it on github [here](https://github.com/s3tools/s3cmd)

#### Step 3 - Configure S3cmd

Now we will configure S3cmd for use scaleway, following a basic configuration example to use HyperScale S3 with S3cmd

```
$cat ~/.s3cfg

[default]
access_key = <your_access_key>
secret_key = <your_secret_key>
default_mime_type = binary/octet-stream
delete_removed = False
dry_run = False
encoding = UTF-8
encrypt = False
follow_symlinks = False
force = False
get_continue = False
guess_mime_type = True
host_base = s3.scaleway.com
host_bucket = %(bucket)s.s3.scaleway.com
human_readable_sizes = False
list_md5 = False
log_target_prefix =
preserve_attrs = True
progress_meter = True
recursive = False
recv_chunk = 4096
reduced_redundancy = False
send_chunk = 4096
skip_existing = False
socket_timeout = 300
urlencoding_mode = normal
use_https = False
verbosity = WARNING
```

replace  `<your_access_key>` with your own access_key and `<your_secret_key>` with the needed token

#### Step 5 - Test it

Ok, now we gonna test our configuration, just try to list all.

```
$s3cmd ls

2014-02-03 12:34  s3://xxxxxx
2014-02-03 12:50  s3://xxxxxx
2014-02-03 12:55  s3://xxxxxx
2014-02-03 13:00  s3://xxxxxx
```
