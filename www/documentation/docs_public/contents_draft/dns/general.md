If you have a domain that you have already registered and you want to manage it from our service, you will need to go to the domain registrar and set our name servers for the domain.

Our name servers are:

```
ns.xxxx.yy
ns.xxxx.yy
```

This  change will take a variable amount of time to propagate to the Internet from your domain registrar, but usually not more than 24 hours.

If you're unsure of your current name servers, a WHOIS search can help you determine which name servers are currently assigned to your domain name. Whenever you change your hosting service provider, the name server information for your domain must be updated to reflect that your site is now being served by a different IP address.
