## What is this cloud platform ?

This platform is a technical preview of the future of cloud computing created by [Online](http://online.net).
It's about providing resources you can rely on.

This platform is designed for people who want to launch and scale their
applications on trustable resources. If you hate unpredictable resources, it's
the place to be.

This platform is made for people who need an easy to use web hosting platform with on demand
resources. You can get your own Linux server on SSD in 44 seconds and with only two clicks !

## What makes Online labs cloud different ?

In our cloud, servers are dedicated. You have dedicated, constant and
predictible performances you can rely on. We are not speaking about dedicated
hosting, it comes with all the benefits of the cloud!

Our platform provides:

- On-demand physical computing servers. [Read more](/howto/create_instance.html)

- Images to create series of servers with predefined configuration. For instance, you can prepare to scale your serving capacity with a frontend image for an Apache server. [Read more](/howto/create_image.html)

- Extra storage volumes for your data, SSD, HDD or both.

- Snapshot to backup your servers and their data. [Read more](/howto/create_snapshot.html)

- Reserved IP addresses movable between your servers for live migration. [Read more](/howto/ip_addresses.html)

- Object storage to upload all your files. [Read more](/howto/s3.html)

You can launch as many physical servers (and not VMs) as you need in seconds, configure networking and manage storage.

storage FAQ](/faq/object_storage_faq.html).
