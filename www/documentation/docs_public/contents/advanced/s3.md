This page shows you how to use Cloud Storage with S3cmd.

> <strong>Requirements</strong>
- You have an account and are logged into [cloud.online.net](//cloud.online.net)
- You have generate your [API Token](/account/credentials.html)

Cloud Storage allows you to store any kind of object (documents, images, videos, etc.) and retrieve them at a later time from anywhere

For instance, you can store images and they will be accessible using HTTP.
You can use the control panel to manage your storage. Some tools exist to interact with cloud storage.

This guide will show you how to use Cloud Storage with one of these tools, S3cmd.<br/>
There are four steps to configure and use S3cmd

- [Retrieve S3 Credentials](/advanced/s3.html#step-1-retrieve-s3-credentials)
- [Download S3cmd](/advanced/s3.html#step-2-download-s3cmd)
- [Configure S3cmd](/advanced/s3.html#step-3-configure-s3cmd)
- [Cloud Storage tour with s3cmd](/advanced/s3.html#step-4-cloud-storage-tour-with-s3cmd)

### Step 1 - Retrieve S3 Credentials

Before starting, click the "Storage" button in the control panel.

You will land on the Storage page. Then, click on the "S3 Credentials" button.<br/>
The credentials required to access Cloud Storage are displayed:

- `host_base`  base url to access Cloud Storage service
- `access_key` the access key required for Cloud Storage 
- `secret_key` the API Token you generated previously.

### Step 2 - Download S3cmd

A simple solution to begin with Cloud Storage is to use the S3cmd tool, which is a client for S3 Cloud Storage.

S3cmd allows you to create, list and delete buckets, download, upload, and delete objects inside the Cloud Storage.
First, you need to download S3cmd on github [here](https://github.com/s3tools/s3cmd).

If you use Linux or OS X, your package manager probably has a package for s3cmd.

### Step 3 - Configure S3cmd

We will configure S3cmd to work with Cloud Storage.
The following is basic configuration example to use Cloud Storage with S3cmd.

In a terminal, create a file named `.s3cfg` in your home directory.<br/>
Replace `access_key = <your_access_key>` and `secret_key = <your_secret_key>` with your credentials

```
$cat ~/.s3cfg

[default]
access_key = <your_access_key>
secret_key = <your_secret_key>
default_mime_type = binary/octet-stream
delete_removed = False
dry_run = False
encoding = UTF-8
encrypt = False
follow_symlinks = False
force = False
get_continue = False
guess_mime_type = True
host_base = fr-1.storage.online.net
host_bucket = %(bucket)s.fr-1.storage.online.net
human_readable_sizes = False
list_md5 = False
log_target_prefix =
preserve_attrs = True
progress_meter = True
recursive = False
recv_chunk = 4096
reduced_redundancy = False
send_chunk = 4096
skip_existing = False
socket_timeout = 300
urlencoding_mode = normal
use_https = False
verbosity = WARNING
```

### Step 4 - Cloud Storage Tour with S3cmd

#### Create a new bucket

The following command will create a bucket to store objects with S3cmd.
A bucket name must contain only alphanumeric and lowercase characters

```
$s3cmd mb s3://mynewbucket

Bucket 's3://mynewbucket/' created
```

#### Upload object into the bucket

The following command will upload `movie1.avi` `photo1.jpg` into the `mynewbucket`

```
$s3cmd put movie1.avi photo1.jpg s3://mynewbucket

movie1.avi -> s3://mynewbucket/movie1.avi  [1 of 2]
 0 of 0     0% in    0s     0.00 B/s  done
photo1.jpg -> s3://mynewbucket/photo1.jpg  [2 of 2]
 0 of 0     0% in    0s     0.00 B/s  done
```

#### List objects inside a bucket

The following command will list the objects inside a bucket

```
$s3cmd ls s3://mynewbucket

2014-09-10 08:44         0   s3://mynewbucket/movie1.avi
2014-09-10 08:44         0   s3://mynewbucket/photo1.jpg
```

#### Download an object from a bucket

The following command will download the object movie1.avi locally

```
$s3cmd get s3://mynewbucket/movie1.avi movie1.avi

s3://mynewbucket/movie1.avi -> movie.avi  [1 of 1]
 0 of 0     0% in    0s     0.00 B/s  done
```

#### Remove object from a bucket

The following command will delete the object movie1.avi from the bucket `mynewbucket`

```
$s3cmd del s3://mynewbucket/movie1.avi

File s3://mynewbucket/movie1.avi deleted
```

#### Remove a bucket

The following command will remove the bucket `mynewbucket`

```
s3cmd rb s3://mynewbucket

Bucket 's3://mynewbucket/' removed
```
