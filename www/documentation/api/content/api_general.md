# Welcome to cloud.online.net API documentation.

We have created an easy to use and RESTful API that allows you to have a full control over the service. All features you will find in the web control panel are also available through the API.

## Request and response

Our api works over https and is accessed from two endpoint:

- `account.cloud.online.net` domain related to account actions
- `api.cloud.online.net` domain related to compute actions

All data is sent and received as json.

## Constructing Requests

Requests are made of two components:

- Base URL: `https://api.cloud.online.net`
- Resource path: `servers`

To construct a proper request, you need to format the URL as follows:

`https://api.cloud.online.net/{ressource}`

Example: `https://api.cloud.online.net/volumes/f929fe39-63f8-4be8-a80e-1e9c8ae22a76`

The following code is an example request to retrieve detailed informations about a volume

```
% curl -H 'X-Auth-Token: 017ce0ce-20ec-4d4ez-b44c-e561a23481d2c' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' https://api.cloud.online.net/volumes/f929fe39-63f8-4be8-a80e-1e9c8ae22a76 -i

    {
      "export_uri": null,
      "id": "f929fe39-63f8-4be8-a80e-1e9c8ae22a76",
      "name": "volume-0-1",

      "volume_type": "l_hdd"
    },
    {
      "export_uri": null,

      "size": 20000000000,
      "volume_type": "l_ssd"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Basic Authentication

You authenticate to the API by requesting a token. You can create a token with a POST request on the /tokens HTTP resource.

Basic Authentication process:

- Query via POST request the /tokens ressource [see here how to](/api/#page:tokens,header:tokens-tokens-collection-post)

- Supply an "X-Auth-Token" header followed by the token you get previously, e.g. "4e0b46e4-7c1d-44d4-8ba6-dc5f80694397"

```
curl -X GET -H "X-Auth-Token: 4e0b46e4-7c1d-44d4-8ba6-dc5f80694397" -H "Content-Type: application/json" https://api.cloud.online.net/{ressources}
```

## Errors

We use conventional HTTP response codes to indicate success or failure of an API request.

In general, codes in the 2xx range indicate success, codes in the 4xx range indicate an error that resulted from the provided information (e.g., a required parameter is missing), and codes in the 5xx range indicate an error with our servers.

### HTTP Status Code Summary

- `200 OK` - Everything worked as expected.
- `400 Bad Request` - Often missing a required parameter.
- `401 Unauthorized` - No valid API key provided.
- `402 Request Failed` - Parameters were valid but request failed.
- `403 Forbidden` - Insufficient privileges to access requested resource.
- `404 Not Found` - The requested item doesn't exist.
- `50x` Server errors - something went wrong on api.cloud.net's end.

Input and output data must be valid JSON with appropriate Content-Type header set.
